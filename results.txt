           "now, it'll be their first summer apart.  Carmen will be with her "
           'dad in South Carolina, Lena will be in Greece with her '

           'and Tibby will stay in town working in store infamously known as '

           'and mailing letters, they would still be together, no matter how '
           'distant they were. <br /> Unlike many other books, the author, Ann '
           'Brashares, is very down-to-earth.  She uses TV shows in her novel '
           'such as, Ricki Lake, Oprah, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and '
           'Jerry Springer.  This also presents the fact that these situations '
           'are capable of happening in real life and is not some fantasy book '
           'where reality is just another term tossed around like a hot '
           'potato. <br />        Another great aspect of this book is the '
           'feeling and description demonstrated.  Every one of her main '
           'characters goes through inclement situations.  Brashares channels '
           'through the hardships and delicacy of her characters in depth.  To '
           'illustrate, one of the characters lost something she always had.  '
           'Brashares put herself in that situation and dug deep to give the '
           'full affect of sorrow and loss. <br /> One fascinating detail I '
           'found in this book was that Ann Brashares, used quotes and sayings '
           'to separate chapters, instead of using numbers.  That really '
           'showed to me that she took the time to teach us, young adults, how '
           "her book affected our lives and other people's lives. <br "
           '/>        Teenage love was alsoincorporated in the book.  Many '
           'adolescent girls have boyfriends and tend to fall for their '
           'crushes.  Brashares definitely hits the mark for harsh rejection '
           'and continuous devotion at the same time.  Her characters have a '
           'complex, deep adoration for their love.  Yet each character was '
           'able to own her sense of weakness. <br /> After reading this book, '
           "I found that with each girl's story there was a lesson.  Carmen "
           'went to South Carolina to visit her divorced father, who she only '
           'visited two to three times a year.  She was frustrated about an '
           'unexpected surprise, but in the end she learned about forgiveness '
           'and learning to start a new life.  Lena discovered that love can '
           'reign over fearfulness and give you courage.  Bridget found that '
           'if you want your goal, the key is to be patient.  Even at '
           "Wallman's, Tibby discerned that no matter what troubles come in "

           'Expecting the kind of giggly girly book found in the \\\\"Gossip '
           'Girl\\\\" series or the \\\\"A-List\\\\" books, I wasn\'t actually '
           'expecting to be touched by this tale at all.  What struck me from '
           'the start was the fact that although the pants are introduced '
           'immediately from the get go, Brashares avoids writing a tale in '
           'which the narrative moves with the pants and the pants alone.  '
           'Instead, we hear all about the girls and their miseries (of which '
           'they each have quite a few) in spite of where the jeans may land.  '
           'The text is broken up into letters, insights, and narratives.  '
           'Anal retentive little beast that I am, I was a little too pleased '
           'to find that the \\\\"handwriting\\\\" of the letters between the '
           'girls was consistent with the text (Lena is described as having '
           'the nicest writing, a fact that the rest of the book attests).<br '
           "/><br />A good way to determine whether or not you'll like this "
           'book is to read the ten rules governing the use of the pants '
           '(provided on the back cover for easy reference).  If you do not '
           'find such rules as \\\\"#2. You must never double cuff the Pants.  '
           "It's tacky.  There will never be a time when this will not be "
           'tacky\\\\" (as true as it is sublime) to be amusing, it\'s '
           'probably best to avoid this book.  I myself was pleased at the '
           'range of characters in it, though.  Certainly the tale falls back '
           "on a lot of old standbys.  There's the hard hearted punk girl that "
           'learns to care about others through the intervention of a child '
           "with cancer (honest).  There's the goddess-like beauty with zero "
           'self-confidence.  But Brashares gives these tried and true '
           'stereotypes a little more life and verve.  She also makes some '
           'literary choices that I approved of.  While acknowledging the '
           'dehumanizing atmosphere of any and all Walmarts, she points out '
           'that the people in them are, in fact, human.  She also, without '
           'actually saying it, makes it clear that the reason the four girls '
           'are as close as they are is because their parents are all so '
           "screwy (with the possible exception of Carmen's mom).  At this "
           "point in the girls' lives they're finally able to see the inherent "
           'flaws of their mothers and fathers without yet being able to '
           'detach themselves fully.  Parents are still important in this '

           'accomplishes this by setting up a dialogue in which all the girls '
           'are present, but Carmen is the main participant initially.  Then, '
           'using a technique prominent in stories with multiple heroes, '
           'Brashares adopts a rotating third person limited point of view for '
           'the body of the novels, which serves as a tool to broaden the '
           'general plotline. Simply stated, by having a chronological access '
           'to into the activities and thought processes of all four '

           'two possible ways: 1. when she is in possession of the pants, or '
           '2. when something of major significance is happening to her. '
           'Therefore the switching view point eliminates the need for '
           'erroneous transitional scenes and allows the events of the book to '
           'all be exciting or informative or, in most cases, both.  For '
           'instance, not one time in any of the three books does Brashares '
           'relate the mundane details of the everyday lives of the girls; at '
           'the point when this would normally occur, she switches point of '
           'view.   <br />Initially, in the original Sisterhood novel, the '
           'switching is slightly confusing.  As I mentioned earlier, Brasher '
           'does a great job of maintaining tone, but at first it is a little '

           'was like an omen to have \\\\"recieved\\\\" the pants just on the '
           'day before they split up for the summer, so they decided to share '
           'the pants with each other over the summer.  I think this was sort '
           'of a way to comfort the girls, to make them feel like they were '
           'together when they were really not.  They decided the order in '
           'which the pants would travel (first Lena, then Tibby, Carmen, '
           'Bridget, and then Bridget, Carmen, Tibby, Lena, each girl keeping '
           'them for no more than one week so they could last the whole '
           'summer) and decided upon a set of rules to follow while wearing '
           'the pants.  Lastly, they took and oath for the pants:     \\\\"To '
           'honor the Pants  And the sisterhood,  And this moment and summer '
           'and rest of our lives,  Together and apart.\\\\"    To you right '
           'now, it may sound kind of stupid to take an oath to a pair of '
           'pants, but this was really improtant to the four girls:  They were '
           'closer than close, and as Carmen said in the Prologue, '
           '\\\\"Sometimes is seems like we\'re so close that we form one '
           'complete person rather than four seperate ones.\\\\" Having the '
           'pants to share was improtant to them.    Once they took the oath, '
           'the wild summer began.  The sisterhood thought that the pants '
           'would bring them good luck, but in truth at first they brought the '
           'opposite.  Lena, who was \\\\"set up with a boy within the first '
           'six hours of her arrival\\\\" in Greece, was caught skinny-dipping '
           "in a lake by the boy, named Kostos.  Lena doens't even want to "
           "know him.  She's beautiful, with long, dark hair, Mediterranean "
           'skin, and \\\\"eyes roughly the color of celery\\\\", so naturally '
           "boys are attracted to her, but Lena doesn't trust them and is very "
           'tough on them.  Kostos is no different.  When her grandmother '
           'finds out (or thinks she finds out) what happened to Lena at the '
           "lake, she tells Lena's grandfather and he goes to find Kostos to "
           'beat him up.  It may sound hilarious at first, but believe me, it '
           "gets serious.  Kostos's grandfather tries to protect Kostos and "
           "the grandfather's then get into a serious fight, resulting Lena's "
           'grandparents hating their otherwise best friends, all because of '
           'her.      The pants are then sent off to Tibby.  Tibby, who is '
           'stuck at home in Bethsda, Maryland, has managed to make friends '
           'with a bothersome 12 year old with leukemia, named Bailey.  Tibby '
           'sees their friendship as something that is just proving how much '
           'she misses her own friends, (a 15 year old hanging out with a 12 '
           'year old?) but then they start to get really close when they begin '
           "filming a documentary together (Tibby's idea).  Bailey meets Tibby "
           'every day at four, the end of her Wallmans shift, and then they '
           'work on the movie together.  TIbby begins to realize that Bailey '
           'looks at people in an entirely different way than she has.  For '
           'example, one day they are sitting at a fast food restaurant and '
           'Tibby sees a guy, Tucker Rowe, that she thinks is really hot.  '
           'Baliey notices who Tibby is looking at, and then claims, \\\\"I '
           'think he looks stupid.  Does he really think those earings look '
           'cool?  And I mean, look at his hair.  How much gel went into that '
           'hair?\\\\" It was then that Tibby began to realize that Bailey saw '
           'people for who they really were on the inside, while Tibby only '
           'saw what was on the outside. Tibby sends the Pants to Carmen, with '
           'a letter including, \\\\"...I can\'t figure out what the Pants '
           "meant to me yet.  It was either profound or not.  I'll tell you "
           'when I know...\\\\"    So, the Pants were off to Carmen.  Carmen, '
           'as I said before, was visiting her out-of-state dad who she '
           "doesn't get to see much since her parents got a divorce.  She had "
           'it all planned out in her head:  what they would do, where they '
           'would go, what his house would be like.  But Carmenn had a huge '
           'surprise awaiting her.  Her father, as said by Carmen, was '
           '\\\\"now Albert and marrying Lydia and lives in a house full of '
           'Kleenex boxes and playing father to two blond people.\\\\"  Carmen '
           "feels she doesn't fit in because she's Puerto Rican(she takes "
           'after he mother) and \\\\"has a big butt\\\\".  In the Pants, she '
